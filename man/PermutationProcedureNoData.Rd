\usage{
PermutationProcedureNoData(dCorr, dNet, tCorr, tNet, moduleAssignments, modules,
  nPermutations, nCores, nullHypothesis, verbose, vCat)
}
\arguments{
\item{dCorr}{matrix of correlation coefficients between all pairs of 
variables/nodes in the \emph{discovery} dataset.}

\item{dNet}{adjacency matrix of network edge weights between all pairs of 
nodes in the \emph{discovery} dataset.}

\item{tCorr}{matrix of correlation coefficients between all pairs of 
variables/nodes in the \emph{test} dataset.}

\item{tNet}{adjacency matrix of network edge weights between all pairs of 
nodes in the \emph{test} dataset.}

\item{moduleAssignments}{a named character vector containing the module 
each node belongs to in the discovery dataset.}

\item{modules}{a character vector of modules for which to calculate the 
module preservation statistics.}

\item{nPermutations}{the number of permutations from which to generate the
null distributions for each statistic.}

\item{nCores}{the number of cores that the permutation procedure may use.}

\item{nullHypothesis}{either "overlap" or "all".}

\item{verbose}{if 'true', then progress messages are printed.}

\item{vCat}{the vCat function must be passed in so that it can be called 
for output logging.}
}
\value{
a list containing a matrix of observed test statistics, and an
  array of null distribution observations.

\details{
\subsection{Input expectations:}{
  Note that this function expects all inputs to be sensible, as checked by
  the R function 'checkUserInput' and processed by 'modulePreservation'. 
  
  These requirements are:
  \itemize{
  \item{The ordering of node names across dCorr' and 'dNet' is consistent.}
  \item{The ordering of node names across 'tCorr' and 'tNet' is consistent.}
  \item{'dCorr', 'dNet', 'tCorr', and 'tNet' are square matrices, and their
        rownames are identical to their column names.}
  \item{'moduleAssigments' is a named character vector, where the names
        represent node labels found in the discovery dataset (e.g. 'dNet').}
  \item{'nPermutations' is a single number, greater than 0.}
  \item{'nCores' is a single number, greater than 0. Note, this number must
        not be larger than the number of cores on your machine, or the 
        number of cores allocated to your job!}
  \item{'nullHypothesis' must be a character vector of lenght 1, containing
        either "overlap" or "all".}
  \item{'verbose' must be a logical vector of length 1 containing either 
        'TRUE' or 'FALSE'.}
  \item{'vCat' must be the function NetRep:::vCat.}
  }
